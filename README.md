# Quojo
A Quantum Computing Simulation written in Mojo

## TODO:
- **Fix Qubits of more than 1 (they're completely wrong at the moment)**
- Implement Uncomputing
- Implement Quantum Circuits
- Add Sample Programs (Quantum Search, Quantum Teleportation)
- Optimize code and make it more readable
  - Parallelize Quantum Gates

## Usage
See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md)

## Complex Number Module
See [COMPLEX.md](COMPLEX.md)

## Sample Programs
### Quantum Search
With a classical computer, a linear search has time complexity $O(n)$. With a Quantum Computer, a Quantum Search has time complexity $O(\sqrt{n})$.
